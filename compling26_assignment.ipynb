        "In human language, words do not always have a fixed meaning. The most striking example is homonymous words: words that have the same form, but very different meanings. For instance, the word \"bank\", which has a different meaning in the context \"I went to the bank to get some money\" and \"At the river bank, I met my old friend\". Polysemous words are words that have different -- yet related -- meanings: for example, \"chicken\" is the same 'entity' in \"My pet chicken is lovely\" and \"I am having roast chicken for dinner\", but has very different meanings in these two contexts. In general, context can modulate almost any word's meaning. This poses a challenge in computational linguistics, as we need to find a way to differentiate among different meanings like humans do. Much research, resources, and models have been put forward to help with this challenge.\n",

In short, the authors explore how good LLMs are at capturing same/different meanings of words across contexts by comparing it to human judgements. To better understand the idea and the research, start by reading the paper.\n",

        "* **Task 3**. Compute the similarity between the contextual word embeddings of the homonyms at different layers and their sense embeddings; explore the relationship between homonyms and dominant senses quantitatively and qualitatively\n",

You have to take that into account when you extract the top sense, so first extract information about which are the most dominant senses for each word across all the parts of speech: for example, \"bat\" might have as its two most common senses bat.n.01 and bat.v.02 (because v.01 might not be available; this is just an example). Some words might only have one part of speech in their synset, some more. Print your results."
